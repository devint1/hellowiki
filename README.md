Hello Wiki
==========

A simple web-based wiki editor written in Go, based on this tutorial: https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/

I attempted to make it MVC-ish, in hopes that this kind of structure can be a starting point for other Go web apps.

Building
-------
- Specify Go workspace by setting `GOPATH`
- `go get github.com/devint1/hellowiki`
